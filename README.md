# Hypothesis-Test-with-R
I will analyze the probability of death in different situation about the cases and deaths in Georgia which are due to COVID-19.


Go a step further, the data set used in this report contains 254019 rows and 6 variables which means there are 254018 cases in Georgia. The cases in this data set are all in the “Any Chronic Condition”, and they have their own gender and race/ethnicity, as an independent individual. During the analysis, I will use hypothesis test including using t.test, prop.test and binom test to test mortality and compare it to the national COVID-19 infection fatality rate during the same period at the same time.


Features:
-- comorbidity : The patient’s chronic disease situation in the case 

-- sex: The patient’s gender in the case

-- ethnicity: The patient’s ethnicity in the case

-- race: The patient’s race in the case 

-- cases: Whether it’s a COVID-19 case (0: not case, 1: case)

-- deaths: Whether this case is fatal or not (0: death occurred, 1: death not occurred)
